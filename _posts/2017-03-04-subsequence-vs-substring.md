title: Subsequence vs. Substring
---

Just saw a comprehensive definition in an algorithm class

A **subsequence** of a sequence (for example, an array, linked list, or string), obtained by removing zero or more elements and keeping the rest in the same sequence order.

A subsequence is called a **substring** if its elements are contiguous in the original sequence.
